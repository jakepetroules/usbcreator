usbcreator
=================

usbcreator is a script that burns bootable ISO images to USB drives, for example to install Linux or other operating systems.

The process for creating bootable USB drives from ISO images is very system-specific and [can be rather involved in the case of OS X](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/#From_Mac_OSX). Instead of having to manually issue several commands - this script reduces that number to one, making the process much quicker and more convenient.

This script only works on OS X at the moment. You may want to look into [Ubuntu Live USB creator](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator) or [UNetbootin](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UNetbootin) for Linux, and [Linux Live USB Creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/download) for Windows.
